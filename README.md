# TPP PBR Statistics 

This is a repisitory for site that keeps track of statistics for TwithPlaysPokemon PBR matches.
It uses the TwitchPlaysleaderboard api to calculate the winrates and display current match statistics.

# Dependancies/libraries
I used the javascript plugin tablesorter to sort the tables.__
