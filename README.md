# TPP PBR Statistics 

This is a repisitory for site that keeps track of statistics for TwithPlaysPokemon PBR matches. <br />
It uses the TwitchPlaysleaderboard api to calculate the winrates and display current match statistics. <br />
You can also watch the stream and interact with people in the chat without having to leave the site. <br />

# Dependancies/libraries
I used the javascript plugin tablesorter to sort the tables.  <br />

I also used veekun.com to get the sprites for the Pokemon  <br />

For design and look of the website I went with Materialize.  <br />

The images I used for the website were from WallpaperLayer <br />

# Athugasemdir
Feedback hlutin af vefsíðunni ekki alveg búinn.
Load tímar á "Current Match" er en þá svolitið langir. 
Feedback takin gæti verið á betri stað.
Mundi vilja bæti inn auka efni á síður eins og Current Match og Twitch stream því þær er nokkuð auðar immit núna.
Það hefði verið gaman að geta set upp user kerfi en ég bara sá mjög litla ástæðu fyrir því.
Í framtíðini mundi ég vilja hafa dynamic front page sem mundi selecta random mynd af safni til að vera aðal myndin.
Databasið er líka svolítið er "bare bones", ég hefði vilja þróa það aðeins meir
