# TPP PBR Statistics 

This is a repisitory for site that keeps track of statistics for TwithPlaysPokemon PBR matches. <br />
It uses the TwitchPlaysleaderboard api to calculate the winrates and display current match statistics. <br />
You can also watch the stream and interact with people in the chat without having to leave the site. <br />

# Dependancies/libraries
I used the javascript plugin tablesorter to sort the tables.  <br />
